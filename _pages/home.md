<img src="/assets/images/beav_creek_raya.jpg" align="left" style="width:200px;height:350px"/>  I am an ecologist and statistician interested in fitting theoretical models of populations and ecological communities to data. I currently work as a [consulting statistician](https://helpdesk.forestry.oregonstate.edu/statistical-consulting?_gl=1*560g0c*_ga*NzI3MTE3MDkwLjE2ODMwNDIyODk.*_ga_P4TKPDKRPV*MTY4MzA0NzM3MS4xLjEuMTY4MzA0NzQ3OC4wLjAuMA..) in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University.


Please excuse any lack of content or bugs in the website as I am in the process of revamping!
